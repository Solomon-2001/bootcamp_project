      <h3>Solomon Ebrahimoff</h3>
      <p> Before bootcamp I have had some programming experiences. 
         In my college I used visual studio on multiple occasions making login screens, 
         booking system and a pizza ordering menu.
         I also have experiencing of using Python in my own time.

    <h3>Bootcamp 2021: Football Data</h3>
    <p>
	My first programming project, concluding the 2 week Programming Bootcamp at 
	City (2021). This Processing project uses an object, arrays and an IF statement.
        I took a data set showing premier league football results from the 2006-2007 season to the 2017-2018 season.
        This meant that I was able to ask questions about the data in processing. As an Arsenal fan, I wanted to know how 
        many times Arsenal won within these seasons. I created an object thet mirrors the data set and I used an IF statement.
        
        If the home team is Arsenal and the result is 'H' meaning the home team won, Arsenal win. 
        If the away team is Arsenal and the result is 'A' meaning the away team won, Arsenal win. 
        The answer is then printed in the processing console.
